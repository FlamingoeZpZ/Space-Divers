# Space-Divers

NOTE: There is a lot of cool things I didn't get to show off:

I'm taking advantage of all OOP principles (Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Abstraction), 

Statics for the WIP blip system, 

I have multiple design patterns (Flyweight, Singletons (light use tho))

The code for the color picker, though I'm sure you know how it works, it's super simple and the manipulation of it in game would be almost identical to how the LUTs are handled.

Unity shader fundamentals: (I needed it to help figure out how to combine the code because the shaders from class were written with vertex and frag instead of surface shaders)
